## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Details

### **Backend Architecture**:

```typescript
// Cross-module activity tracking
await UnifiedIntegrationService.trackActivity(
  userId,
  'gang',
  'connection_accepted',
  connectionId,
  'connection',
  { recipientId, connectionStrength: 50 }
);

// Unified user context
const context = await UnifiedUserContext.findOne({ userId });
context.crossModuleProfile.networkMetrics.influenceScore = 85;

// Cross-module notifications
await UnifiedNotification.create({
  recipient: userId,
  type: 'gang_job_post',
  title: 'Job Application Update',
  message: 'John applied to a new job',
  data: {
    sourceModule: 'jobs',
    targetModule: 'gang',
    crossModuleContext: { connectionStrength: 70 }
  }
});
```

### **Frontend Integration**:

```typescript
// Unified activity feed
const activities = await apiService.getUnifiedActivityFeed(page, limit);

// Cross-module recommendations
const recommendations = await apiService.getCrossModuleRecommendations();

// Network insights
const insights = await apiService.getNetworkInsights();

// Activity tracking
await apiService.trackActivity('community', 'post_created', postId, 'post');
```
