# Critical: Check Railway Build Logs

## Issue

Your logs only show "Starting Container" - this is the **DEPLOY** phase.  
We need to see the **BUILD** phase logs where `npm ci` and `npm run build` should run.

## ⚠️ WHERE TO FIND BUILD LOGS

In Railway dashboard:

### Method 1: Deployment Details
1. Go to **Deployments** tab
2. Click on the **latest deployment**
3. You should see **TWO sections**:
   - 📦 **Build Logs** (this is what we need!)
   - 🚀 **Deploy Logs** (this is what you've been sharing)

### Method 2: Real-time View
1. While deployment is running
2. Look for tabs or sections labeled:
   - "Build"
   - "Deploy"
   - "Logs"

## 🔍 What Build Logs Should Show

**IF railway.json is working**:
```
====== Build Phase ======
Running build command: npm ci && npm run build

npm ci
added 500 packages in 30s

npm run build
> tsc
Compiling TypeScript...
✓ Build completed successfully
```

**IF railway.json is NOT working**:
```
====== Build Phase ======
Nixpacks auto-detecting...
Detected Node.js
Installing dependencies...
✓ Dependencies installed
(No custom build command)
```

## 🚨 If There Are NO Build Logs

If you don't see a separate "Build" section, it means Railway is skipping the build entirely. This happens when:

1. **Railway thinks there's nothing to build**
2. **Nixpacks finds a pre-built dist/ folder somewhere**
3. **Build configuration is being ignored**

## ✅ SOLUTION: Force Build with Nixpacks Config

Let me create a `nixpacks.toml` file which Railway MUST respect:

This will override everything and force Railway to build.
