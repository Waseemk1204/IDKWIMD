## 🐛 Critical Bug Found & Fixed

### LinkedIn OAuth Redirect Bug

**🚨 SEVERITY: HIGH**

#### Problem Description:
- Clicking "Continue with LinkedIn" was redirecting users to Google OAuth instead
- Affected both `/login` and `/signup` pages
- Users unable to authenticate with LinkedIn credentials

#### Root Cause:
Both LinkedIn and Google auth buttons were incorrectly configured with the same callback handlers:
- LinkedIn button used `handleGoogleSuccess` instead of `handleLinkedInSuccess`
- LinkedIn button used `handleGoogleError` instead of `handleLinkedInError`

#### Console Evidence:
```javascript
[LOG] LinkedInAuthButton - handleLinkedInAuth called
[LOG] Initiating LinkedIn OAuth flow...
[LOG] LinkedIn OAuth URL: https://www.linkedin.com/oauth/v2/authorization...
[LOG] Redirecting to LinkedIn...
[LOG] LinkedInAuthButton - Success, calling onSuccess
[LOG] Initiating Google OAuth login   // ❌ BUG: Should be LinkedIn!
```

#### Fix Applied:
✅ Added `handleLinkedInSuccess()` function to Login.tsx  
✅ Added `handleLinkedInError()` function to Login.tsx  
✅ Added `handleLinkedInSuccess()` function to Signup.tsx  
✅ Added `handleLinkedInError()` function to Signup.tsx  
✅ Updated LinkedInAuthButton props to use correct handlers  
✅ Rebuilt frontend  
✅ Committed & pushed to GitHub  

**Git Commit:** `df77a26` - "fix: LinkedIn OAuth redirecting to Google instead of LinkedIn"
