    Fix role selection using URL path encoding
    
    ISSUE: Cookies not being sent reliably with OAuth POST
    - SameSite=Lax cookies not sent on cross-origin POST from Google
    
    SOLUTION: Encode role in redirect URI path
    - Employee: /signup/employee
    - Employer: /signup/employer
    - Backend extracts role from URL path
    - No cookie dependency
    
    BACKEND CHANGES:
    - Add separate routes for /signup/employee and /signup/employer
    - handleGoogleOAuth accepts signupRole parameter
    - Create user with role from URL parameter
    
    FRONTEND CHANGES:
    - Build redirect URI with role path
    - Removed cookie-based role passing
    
    VERCEL ROUTING:
    - Add POST routes for /signup/employee and /signup/employer
    
    GOOGLE CLOUD CONSOLE:
    Add these redirect URIs:
    - https://parttimepays.in/signup/employee
    - https://parttimepays.in/signup/employer
    
    This ensures the correct role is used for user creation!
